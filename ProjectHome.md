An implementation of the BCL and other .NET libraries in pure Python (for porting IronPython code to CPython).

The main goal of this project is to allow [Resolver One](http://www.resolversystems.com) spreadsheets exported as code to run under CPython. I will implement the .NET classes needed for this, but this project should be helpful for anyone wanting to run IronPython code under CPython.
